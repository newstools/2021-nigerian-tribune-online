The road project which covers 550 meters and dilapidated over the years was funded by Dunamis Church, Karu/Jikwoyi branch. Commissioning the road project, Pastor Enenche accompanied by his wife, Dr Becky Enenche, said the major assignment of leadership is to cater for the welfare of the people. He said the church embarks on monthly outreach where it trains people on skills acquisition and trade, while on a quarterly basis, it embarks on mega outreach like renovation of schools and transformers. “I believe that the light is been shone and within the capability and the possibility that it is, the very major assignment of leadership is the welfare of the people. And I believe that as the look more at the welfare of the people, we will have a better life for the people. “On a monthly basis, we have a welfare outreach to people, empowering people to do a lot of things like tailors, traders. Quarterly basis, we also have mega outreaches, renovation of schools, transformers and so on. So, this is a lifelong outreach as long as the gospel remains. On the maintenance of the project, Dr Enenche said the church is permanently responsible for the maintenance of the road project.
