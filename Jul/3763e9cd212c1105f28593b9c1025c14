A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Monday, threatened to issue a bench warrant of arrest on former Aviation Minister, Senator Stella Oduah, if she fails to appear in court on next adjourned date of October 19 for her arraignment on an alleged N10 billion fraud The trial judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo, issued the threat following the continuous refusal to appear in court to honour proceedings Oduah, now a senator, representing Anambra North Senatorial District in the Senate, was billed to be arraigned on Monday on 25-count charges but she was not in court along with the fourth defendants. When the matter came up on Monday, counsel to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Dr. Hassan Liman, informed the court that all the defendants had been served with the charges as ordered by court and expressed disgust that the former minister was again not in court. He told the court that the prosecution had lined up 32 witnesses to testify against the former minister and eight others in order to establish the fraud charges against them. Justice Ekwo, while fixing October 19 for the arraignment of the former minister and commencement of trial, warned the absentee defendants to be in court on the date or have bench warrant of arrest issued against them.
