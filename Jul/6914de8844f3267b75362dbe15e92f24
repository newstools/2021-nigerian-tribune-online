Against the earlier report that the daughter of the slain Managing Director of the Science Equipment Development Institute (SEDI), Professor Innocent Ndubuisi was abducted, it has now been confirmed that her abductors later dropped her on the way, ostensibly because of the bullet wound she had sustained during the attack. The killer band reportedly arrived at the spot in a Toyota Hilux pickup van mounted with a revolving beacon and siren. The driver of the slain professor was hit by bullets shot at the car and is presently receiving medical attention at a hospital in town. Meanwhile, the Enugu state police command is still at sea concerning this dastardly act. PPRO, Dan Ndukwe, said that information was still sketchy. He said, “Information surrounding a shooting incident today, 07/07/2021 at about 1600hrs, along Enugu/Port-Harcourt Expressway, said to have led to the death of a man and his police orderly, is still sketchy. Meanwhile, a preliminary investigation has commenced. Further development will be duly communicated, please”. A sympathiser at the home of the slain professor, who did not want to be named drew a correlation between the killers and the robbers at the supermarket. “These people are not Igbos and they seem to be hiding somewhere with those they kidnapped. And they may be the same people that robbed a supermarket and carried foodstuff and gas cylinders. This suggests that they are camped somewhere they can cook, and this reminds me of what  I read today of kidnappers demanding food for their victims ahead of the payment of ransom,” he said.
