The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) on Monday said the formation of a legal team by Ohanaeze Ndigbo to monitor proceedings at the trial of the self-acclaimed leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu was a welcome development. Malami said setting up the team was in line with the doctrine of the right of fair hearing rooted in Section 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria “Inherent in the position of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo on the matter was the demonstration of their recognition of belonging to Nigeria and succumbing to the rule of law while maintaining their stance that they were not averse to the trial of Nnamdi Kanu”, Malami stated in a statement. The group, he said showed a mature departure from the mindset of IPOB when it said they, “Do not support the use of any form of violence” while channelling concerns and presenting demands. “By urging the youths to be law-abiding and sheath their sword as well as asking them to try to obtain voter’s card to enable them to contribute to national development, the position of Ohanaeze becomes glaringly constitutional and commendable”, the statement signed by Malami’s media aide, Dr Umar Gwandu stated. The AGF said, President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government respects the rule of law and does not advocate for the breach of law, adding that, with or without the so-called monitoring group, justice will be adequately served to Nnamdi Kanu in compliances with the enshrined provisions of the law. He expressed the hope that the unnecessary legal monitoring group will come with open-mind and guided by nothing but the rule of law in the process so as to convey the judgment of the Court as may eventually be delivered to their people in various languages and dialects of the members of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo communities and the entire Nigerians.
