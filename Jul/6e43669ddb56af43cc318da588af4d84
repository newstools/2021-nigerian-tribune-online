POULTRY farmers in Oyo State have been called up to rev up security around their farms particularly during the eid-el-Kabir season. The call was made by the Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), Oyo State chapter in a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan. The statement reads: “This is to bring to our notice that there have been incidences of reported theft in farms across Oyo, Ogbomoso and some areas in Ibadan. “These Robbers were reported to have invaded these farms in the middle of the night with “Micra” cars carting away chicken, feeds and concentrates. “These type of occurrence normally happen only during Christmas and New Year festivities. Surprisingly, this is coming close to Eid-el-Kabir otherwise known as Ileya festival. “We, therefore, strongly advice farmers to upscale the security on their farms as these notorious criminals will stop at nothing to perpetrate their evil acts.” The statement read. The association also advised that farmers should report any suspicious movements around their farms to law enforcement agents for prompt action.
