The Christ Apostolic Church, Yemetu DCC Superintendent, Pastor Benjamin Akanmu, has called on Nigerians, especially Christians, to wake up to the work of God spiritually and physically, and proclaim the gospel of God as commanded according to the Bible. Akanmu explained that the work of God is been dragging due to our nonchallant attitude as Christians. “Christians are taking God’s work with levity, compared to our daily jobs,” he said. The superintendent stated this during the 15th church anniversary of Christ Apostolic Church, Hand of God Miracle Centre (HAGOM) ordination of deacons and deaconesses, and award service, with the theme: ‘Who is the King of glory?’ Pastor Akanmu urged the Church and church leaders to stop encouraging and promoting materialism, and ego above the primary calling and purpose of the Church.
