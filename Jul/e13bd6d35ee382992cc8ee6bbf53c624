Looking into the week ahead, Analysts at Cordros advised investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks. “With the moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks this week, we expect savvy investors to take advantage of this and make re-entry ahead of their H1-21 earnings announcement. However, we do not rule out the possibility of continued profit-taking activities. As a result, we think the local bourse will likely exhibit a zig-zag pattern.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Buhari Urges MTN For Quality Service, Downward Price Review In Cost Of Data, Other Services President Muhammadu Buhari Friday at State House Abuja urged the MTN Group to make the available top-of-the-range service to its Nigerian subscribers…  Local stock market bows to profit taking  ;  Local stock market bows to profit taking  ;  Local stock market bows to profit taking  ;  Local stock market bows to profit taking.
