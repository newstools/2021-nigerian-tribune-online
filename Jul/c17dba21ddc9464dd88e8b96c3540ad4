The scheduled mega rally by Yoruba Nation agitators, which could not hold on a larger scale due to heavy police presence at the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ojota, Lagos on Saturday turned bloody as police reportedly shot dead a 14-year-old girl. The mega rally, which was planned and scheduled by Yoruba activist, Mr. Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho, was outlawed about 24 hours earlier by the state government, who said the timing for the event was not right as the state was still in pains following the huge destruction suffered during the last #EndSARS protests. The 14-year-old was said to be running following gun shots by the  police aimed at dispatching the protesters, when a stray bullet allegedly hit her from the back, leading to her death. It was gathered that the little girl was not part of the original protesters. Police is yet to react to the development as Sunday Tribune is already making contacts with the State Police Command.
