Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) has hailed scores of Yoruba people who defied what it called police intimidation and harassment to show solidarity with the agitation for a separate country. It said their action, despite police posturing, symbolises that the Yoruba people are not cowards and that the struggle continues. The group, led by the Second Republic senator, Prof Banji Akintoye, gave this commendation in a release made available to newsmen by its Media Communications Secretary, Mr Maxwell Adeleye. This was just as it alleged that a stray bullet fired by the officer of the Nigeria police gunned down a soft drinks seller at the venue of the rally at Ojota. The umbrella body of all self-determination groups said the tumultuous crowd, led by the General Secretary and Legal Adviser of the group, George Akinola and Olasupo Ojo respectively, were dispersed by armed-to-the-teeth officers of the Nigeria Police, Army, DSS and Civil Defense Corps with teargas and live bullets despite being peaceful and orderly. It, however, saluted the women who led the rally from the front and appreciated the gentlemen of the media who trooped out to cover the rally despite all inconveniences, declaring that the rally held notwithstanding the attempts to ensure it did not happen in Lagos. “We have held our rally, notwithstanding, the heavy attempts to ensure we do not come to Lagos. That the people came out in their thousands is an indication that the Yoruba people are not cowards. “We thank our women who led the rally from the front. May history be kind to them. We thank the gentlemen of the press for their support and solidarity. “This is the beginning. It is no retreat, no surrender. The struggle continues. We are marching forward in the struggle to liberate our land from the shackles of oppression and intimidation,” the statement said.  Learn how to code in Nigeria as a beginner.
