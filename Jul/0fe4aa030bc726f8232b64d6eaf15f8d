Former governor of Zamfara State and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Ahmad Sani, has said he remained committed to his 2023 presidential ambition. He made the declaration on the heels of the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum which met on Monday and demanded for power shift to the South. Speaking in Abuja with newsmen, Senator Sani said he would not shelve his ambition since there was no provision for power shift in the Nigeran constitution and the APC constitution. He said:”Nigerians should know that democracy is democracy. We are not the one that brought democracy, there is nothing in our constitution that talks about moving power from one place to another. Every Nigerian, according to the Nigeria constitution, unless it is amended, has the right to aspire to any political office once he is qualified. “So, it is not wrong for anybody to say he is contesting the election, even from Daura. Any person from Daura local government where the president comes from can aspire to be president, governor or anything in Nigeria. You cannot say this is my turn because it is about election. “You, all of us are going to go for election to elect the person that we think should be president. Our problem in Nigeria is that this issue of citizenship has not been accepted fully in Nigeria. “We still have tribal, ethnic and religious differences which is very wrong. And until and such a time we believe that we are Nigerians, then the issue of Hausa, Fulani, Igbo, Ijaws, people will continue.” On the insinuation of power tussle in Zamfara State chapter of the APC arising from the defection of the state governor, Bello Matawalle, the former governor said the party constitution was clear on the leader of the party. He urged his colleagues to defer to Governor Matawalle whom he noted had since emerged as the party leader by provisions of the APC Constitution.
