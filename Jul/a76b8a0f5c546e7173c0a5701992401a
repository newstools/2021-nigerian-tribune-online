Popular actress, Funke Akindele-Bello, Nigerian disk jockey, Oluseye Sodamola and other prominent artists have inuagurate the newly-built Total Grace Oil and Gas filling station in the Lekki area of Lagos State. Speaking on the occasion, the Executive Chairman, Total Grace Oil & Gas, Dr Henry Akinduro, said that the station was built with the innovation of electrical charging points. Henry noted that it is the first filling station with such innovation in Nigeria in a bid to ensure that Nigerians enjoy the best product. “And this is the only filling station in Nigeria that has an electrical charging point. Here, we are friendlier and every month end, we give out gifts. “And also, we are trying to bring innovation into the industry. We believe we can sell at a reasonable price and still make a profit. “This is our first filling station in Lagos. We have in Ibadan, Oyo State and other states. “And we discovered that there is no faithfulness in terms of measurement in Lagos specifically. “We have decided to make sure that our one litre is one litre. So, that is why it is different from other filling stations in Nigeria. “We chose this location because development is moving from this side. The refinery is coming from here. The New Airport is coming from here,” he said
