A cleric in Osun state, Evangelist Paul Olusegun Oyeniran has called on the federal government to desist from unwarranted arrest and intimidation of citizens of the country, just as he said, such an act is un-Godly and inimical to the scripture. Evangelist Oyediran who is the General overseer of the Ambassador of Christ Teaching and Evangelical Ministries, ACTEM stated this while speaking with newsmen in Ode Omu in Ayedaade local government of the state over the weekend. According to the man of God, the present administration of President Mohammadu Buhari has started well but need to take caution in the area of unwarranted invasion of the citizens which may cause a spontaneous reaction from the people in the country. Oyediran cited the invasion of Sunday Igboho at Soka in Ibadan by the men of Department of State Service (DSS) as an example which has been generating a lot of reactions, adding that, the federal government should be seen as creating a peaceful atmosphere rather than causing panic and unnecessary apprehension in the land due to its actions. He admonished the government to tow a lane of peace and not allow segregation in the country which may occured as a result of their present actions. The general overseer of the ACTEM also enjoined the federal government to rather called for peace and unity as it enshrined in our national anthem and pledge and not disintegration which may arise as a result of the present insecurity bedevilling the nation.
