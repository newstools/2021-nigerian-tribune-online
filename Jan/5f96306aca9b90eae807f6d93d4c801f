There was mayhem in Ogboro, Orlu, Imo State, on Monday when the hostilities between the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and soldiers became worsened. Ten residents were reportedly killed, while over 13 buildings and shops were burnt. Sources informed the Nigerian Tribune that the soldiers, who were initially deployed to dismantle the formations of the ESN, were almost subdued by the superior forces of the IPOB vigilante, culminating in the alleged killing of one of the soldiers during a gun duel. Apparently irked by the killing, the soldiers retreated and launched a reprisal, shooting sporadically and killing some of the residents. According to one of the sources, “the soldiers came back to search for the vigilante that killed their colleague, but in the process started shooting at everybody they see. I can’t actually say how many have died, they are many but I think I counted over 10.” Reacting to the clash, the media and publicity secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, said “I have said it time without number, did we go to their barracks to look for their trouble or they came into our forest to attack us?” As of the time of filing this report, many of the people from the troubled area had fled their homes, as tension pervaded the community. Meanwhile, Governor Hope Uzodimma has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the affected areas, just as he ordered security agencies to fish out the perpetrators. He maintained that the curfew is an interim measure to immediately restore peace in Orlu, Orsu, Oru East, Oru West, Ideato North, Ideato South, Njaba, Isu, Nwangele and Nkwerre local government areas of Orlu zone. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Oguwike Nwachwuku, Uzodimma said “I have directed the security agencies to fish out, without fail, all those behind the carnage and immediately bring them to book.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
