THREE security personnel were feared killed, while another one is currently receiving treatment at the IBB Specialist Hospital in Minna, Niger State after the first son of General Ibrahim Babangida, former military president, Mohammed, and his family members’ convoy was involved in an accident on Monday evening on the Minna-Suleja Road. It was gathered that Mohammed and his family members escaped death by the whiskers after the lead vehicle in the convoy had a head-on collision with a truck loaded with tomatoes. Nigerian Tribune gathered that three security personnel, believed to be soldiers in the convoy, were said to have died after their black Prado Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) collided with the truck which was travelling in the opposite direction. It was further gathered that Mohammed, who was believed to be heading to Abuja, was inside a Honda Space bus with other members of his family behind the security vehicle. No member of the family was affected by the accident. Details of how the incident occurred were still very unclear, but an eyewitness informed Nigerian Tribune that a bad portion of the dual-carriage highway at Mallam Karu village, where vehicles divert to one lane, was responsible for the collision. Sympathisers have continued to throng the Uphill residence of the Babangidas in Minna, the Niger State capital, over the incident. SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that
