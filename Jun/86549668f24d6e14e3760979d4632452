The heavy rainfall that fell of Tuesday morning in Abuja affected the National Assembly complex. Checks revealed that the downpour caused the entrance of Senate’s wing of the National Assembly to be flooded as a result of leaking roof. Cleaners were subsequently directed to mop the water from the entrance of Senate wing of National Assembly. Investigation revealed that last year, there was public outcry against the alleged allocation of N27 billion for the renovation of the National Assembly Complex in Abuja in the 2020 Budget. Director General of the Budget Office, Ben Akabueze, later clarified that only N9.2 billion was provided for renovation/retrofitting of the National Assembly (NASS) complex in the revised budget as against N27 billion. He further disclosed that “the initial provision of N37bn in the 2020 Appropriation Act for this was cut by 75 per cent due to the impact of COVID-19 on government revenues.”
