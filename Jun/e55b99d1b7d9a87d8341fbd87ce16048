As a result of the bullish weekly outing, the Month-to-Date (MtD) return turned positive 0.7 per cent, while the Year-to-Date (YTD) loss moderated to -3.8 per cent. During the week under review, performance across sectors was mixed, with the Industrial and Insurance indices recording gains by 2.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively, while the Consumer Goods and Oil and Gas indices closed in the red by -0.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent.

They accounted for 235.953 million shares worth N1.820 billion in 1,654 deals, contributing 21.8 per cent and 19.07 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. Looking ahead, analysts expect stock market performance to be dominated by the bulls in the coming weeks as investors positioned in dividend-paying stocks ahead of H1-2021 dividend declarations, which should outweigh profit-taking activities. Analysts at Cordros Capital, therefore reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remained a significant headwind for corporate earnings.
