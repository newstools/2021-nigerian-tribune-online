The rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of Friday after trailing the kidnappers from Yawuri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled, with one group conveying the abducted children , while the second group conveyed rustled cattle. According to a statement by Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, the Director, Army Public Relations, the land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 a.m. and engaged them in a fire fight leading to the rescue of the teachers and students. The troops were also said to have recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits. According to the statement: “The gallant troops are still on the heels of the kidnappers in order to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity. “Sadly, a casualty was recorded during the exchange. A female student was found to have given up the ghost as a result of exhaustion. The rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State government. “The Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good spirited citizens and wish to solicit for more. The Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, has directed the commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones.” SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
