Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, on Wednesday, dealt another blow on the old Edo Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as he appointed his close ally from the All Progressive Congress (APC) Mr Iyoha Osaigbovo Toni, as his Chief of Staff. The appointment of Iyoha, who decamped from the APC alongside Obaseki in 2020, marks the end of the possibility of any of the core PDP members, who rescued the political career of the governor, making the list of the inner caucus of the second term of the governor, Obaseki having retained his former deputy governor in APC, Philip Shaibu, and the former Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Osaradion Ogie. Announcing Iyoha’s appointment in a statement, the SSG, Ogiee, said the appointment takes immediate effect. The newly appointed Chief of Staff served as the immediate Special Adviser to the governor on Political Matters (Edo South) and was at a time, a member of the Edo State House of Assembly representing Oredo East Constituency, from 2015 to 2019. According to Ogie, “Hon Iyoha Osaigbovo Toni, born on 6th of July 1973, holds a Bachelors’ degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ambrose Alli University, (formerly Edo State University) and a Masters of Engineering degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Benin (UNIBEN). “He is presently concluding a PhD in Industrial Engineering from UNIBEN. He is a member of the Nigerian Society of Engineers.” YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE No!
