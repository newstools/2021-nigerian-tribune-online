Despite recording a gain on three of the week’s four trading sessions, the local stock market closed the four-day trading sessions in the red zone. Investors took full advantage of the gains recorded over the last two weeks in booking profit on bellwether stocks to close last week with 1.3 per cent weekly depreciation in the All-share Index (ASI). Consequently, the ASI of the Nigerian Exchange Limited settled at 38,648.91 basis points, just as the Market Capitalisation depreciated to N20.143 trillion after shedding N366 billion. Specifically, foreign investors’ sell-offs of Airtel Africa, Okumu Oil and Stanbic IBTC drove the weekly loss as their shares depreciated by 10.0 per cent, 9.4 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively. Consequently, the Month-to-Date (MtD) return decreased to 0.5 per cent, while the Year-to-Date (YtD) loss increased to -4.0 per cent. On the other hand, sectoral performance was broadly positive as the Banking, Oil and Gas, Insurance, and Consumer Goods indices recorded gains by 1.1 per cent, 1.0 per cent, 0.8 per and 0.2 per cent respectively. Elsewhere, the Industrial Goods index closed flat. During the week under review, activity levels were mixed, as trading volume declined by 9.4 per cent, while trading value rose by 8.8 per cent. A total turnover of 981.147 million shares worth N10.384 billion in 15,001 deals were traded by investors on the floor of the Exchange last week, in contrast to a total of 1.058 billion shares valued at N12.831 billion that exchanged hands in 17,854 deals in the preceding week.
