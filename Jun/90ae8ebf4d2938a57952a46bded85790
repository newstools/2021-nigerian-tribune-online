Groups of young Nigerians have, on Saturday, June 12, embarked on a peaceful protest in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The protest to mark June 12 Democracy Day moved from the popular Mokola Roundabout on to the Unversity of Ibadan. Their message is no to kidnapping, rape and bad governance. Though security personnel including the Nigeria Police Force, Nigerian Civil Defence, Amotekun corps and even the Federal Road Safety Corps were on ground at the major roads on the state, there has been no confrontation between them and the protesters at the time of this report.
