Former governor of Sokoto state, Alhaji Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa, has called for meeting of eminent Nigerians with a view to offering solutions to the myriad of security challenges facing the country.

Bafarawa said these in a press statement on Sunday, calling on all politicians and other eminent citizens to come together for the common good of the country. “We should do everything possible to contribute our quota towards peace and security of the country,” he said. He admitted that the country is facing insecurity challenges resulting from increased level of poverty. Bafarawa noted that such challenges are important issues that call for deliberation. “We should do everything possible at our disposal to contribute our quota towards peace and security of the country,” he added.
