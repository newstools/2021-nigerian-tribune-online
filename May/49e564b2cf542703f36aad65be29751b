The biography account of the former president, written by his former aide, Femmy Carrena, was officially launched in December 2020. The donation of the books to the Obasanjo Library for onward distribution to schools and libraries is to commemorate Obasanjo’s 84th birthday in arrears. According to Afolabi: “Chief Obasanjo has done so much for Nigeria and he should be celebrated. These books will be distributed to selected federal tertiary institutions nationwide so that our leaders of tomorrow can see the true leader in him. They can choose to make him a role model. It’s a must read for university students, especially.” The presentation programme is expected to come up at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Oke Mosan, Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Thursday, June 3, 2021, by 11am. The entire 4,000 copies will be received by former President Obasanjo on behalf of the Library.

According to Carrena, who is the author of the book, he is passionate about anything on the former President Obasanjo because he has impacted humanity at all levels.
