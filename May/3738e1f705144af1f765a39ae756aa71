The Rivers State Command of the Nigeria Police has released a detailed account of the Friday night attacks by gunmen on some police checkpoints and stations in some parts of the state. A press statement by the spokesman of the command, Nnamdi Omoni said there were three of such mindless attacks at three different points namely; special checkpoint at Choba bridge Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Rumuji Police station in Emohua Local Government and Elimgbu Police station in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area. In the surprising attack at Choba, two Policemen on duty were killed and a private car belonging to one of the policemen set ablaze. According to Omoni, a stiff resistance by the Police prevented the hoodlums from gaining access into the police station and in the course of the exchange of fire, two of the attackers were fatally wounded on the spot. “In the third attack at Elimgbu Police Station, they were equally resisted by the Police, though three officers were killed in that attack, the serious fire engagement made them abandon their bullet-riddled Hilux van, while they escaped with various degrees of gunshot wounds with a snatched Sienna bus.
