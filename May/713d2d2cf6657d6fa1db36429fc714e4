Some gunmen on Saturday evening reportedly attacked the Umuagu Police Station in Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State and razed the facility. Tribune Online gathered that the attack on Umuagu Police station came barely two weeks after gunmen burnt down the Ubakala Police station in Umuahia South Area of the state and killed two police officers on duty. Tribune Online also learnt that the current attack on the Umuagu police formation had heightened tension in the state, leading many residents of Umuahia, the capital city to scamper for safety over the fear of being hit by stray bullets. At the time of filing this report, no casualty has been announced. Attempts to speak with the Public Relations Officer of the Abia State Police Command, DSP Godfrey Ogbonna, proved abortive, as his phone lines could not be reached for confirmation. The arsonists were believed to be the same set of gunmen that have been terrorising the people of the South-East geopolitical zone of the country for close to two months running.
