THE immediate past vice-president of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, has emerged as the new president of the union. Osodeke, who confirmed the development to Nigerian Tribune on telephone, said he was elected alongside other executive members of the union early Sunday during a three-day conference of the union held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State. A professor of soil science at the Federal University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, Osodeke took over from Biodun Ogunyemi, a professor of education at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State. Other members of the union who were elected alongside Mr Osodeke, include Chris Piwuna of the University of Jos as vice president; Olusiji Sowande of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Ogun State, as treasurer while Ade Adejumo, a professor from the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, (LAUTECH), Ogbomosho, was elected as financial secretary. Also, a lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt, Austen Sado, was elected as investment secretary; Adamu Babayo from Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Bauchi, was elected the union’s internal auditor while Stella-Maris Oke from Cross Rivers State University of Science and Technology, was elected as the new welfare secretary. Ogunyemi will continue to serve in the new executive committee as an ex-officio, apparently to guide the new leadership.
