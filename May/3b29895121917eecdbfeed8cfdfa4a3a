Authorities of a secondary school, St. Clairs Anglican Girls Grammar School located in the ancient town of Offa, Offa Local Government Area of Kwara State, has reportedly been closed down the school following strange happening in the school premises. Tribune Online gathered that some students of the school reportedly heard voices, suspected to be those of demons, at about 12:00 am on Friday. It was also gathered that the strange incident caused panic among students and teachers of the school, as it was reported that students ran out of their classes and school hostels, falling and rolling on the ground. The school authorities have been confounded by the strange development, according to the Senior Principal, Mrs. F.B Ogunwole, who asked parents and guardians of students to come and evacuate their children. One of the old students of the school, simply identified as Mrs Agbede, said she experienced same strange development during her school days, many years ago. In a statement by the spokesman of the Kwara State command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Babawale Afolabi, said that, “when we contacted the school, Mrs Ogunwole informed us that the incident took the school management by surprise, adding that she suspected ‘demons’, as the same ugly incident happened in 1978. “A student, Uthman Mariam, 17, also said that she saw some girls dressed in different colours and calling her to join them, but she refused to answer their calls as they wanted to force her to mingle with them. “That was why she was shouting and fell unconsciously on the floor”, he said  BUY OR SELL YOUR CAR IN 5 MINUTES WITH 2020CARS.NET CLICK HERE.
