Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) has announced the postponement of its 61st AGM and investiture ceremony until further notice. The reason for the postponement was not stated but it may not be unassociated with the insecurities in the South-East. The announcement was made in a statement signed by NACCIMA’s National President, Hajiya Saratu Iya Aliyu on Sunday. “Afer due consultations within the NACCIMA Presidency and with members across the country, this is to inform all members of NACCIMA of the postponement of the 61st AGM/Conference and investiture ceremony of the new president previously scheduled for 2nd and 3rd June at Aba. “Further announcements will be made on new dates and arrangements for both the AGM and Investiture Ceremony. We regret any inconvenience this postponement may have caused members.” Business mogul, Sir John Ide Udeagbala is to take over from Hajiya Aliyu as President, while Chief Dele Oye is to be installed as the 1st National Deputy President.
