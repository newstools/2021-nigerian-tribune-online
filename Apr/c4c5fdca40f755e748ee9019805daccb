In a statement by the Commission’s Head of Media, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, Dabiri-Erewa said she was deeply pained by the death of the young Nigerian who tried to save someone else’s life, described him as a hero that was never to be forgotten. She passionately appealed to the family of Jimi to be consoled with the fact that Jimi died as a fearless hero and will be forever remembered as a martyr. Dabiri-Erewa prayed unto God to allow Jimi’s soul rest in perfect peace and comfort his aged parents, family and friends in the best manner. “This is a very painful and sad incident for a young promising Jimi to die this way sacrificing his life. “Undoubtedly, Jimi with this courageous and selfless act, has earned himself the sobriquet of an hero and attained the highest form of death, martyrdom”, she said.
