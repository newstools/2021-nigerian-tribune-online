The Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai has met with the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Tuesday. The meeting took place at the governor’s office in Kaduna. Pastor Adeboye’s meeting with the governor comes on the heels of the recent kidnap of eight members of RCCG who were abducted in Kaduna State over two weeks ago. The General Overseer of RCCG had announced the release of the victims last Thursday through his Twitter handle. The members belonged to Region 30, Trinity Sanctuary, Kaduna. They were kidnapped along Kachia-Kafanchan Road, on their way to a programme. It could not be ascertained as of the filing the report whether ransoms were paid before their release.
