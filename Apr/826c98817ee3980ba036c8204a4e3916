The Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC) has shifted date for local government election in the state from the earlier scheduled May 15 date to May 22. Chairman, OYSIEC, Mr Isiaka Olagunju, made this disclosure at the beginning of the state-wide voter education and mobilisation campaign towards the local government election organised by the National Orientation Agency (NOA), in Ibadan. The OYSIEC Chairman said the one week shift became expedient owing to discovery that the Ed-el-Fitr celebration and holidays will fall around the previous May 15 date. While assuring that the OYSIEC will be impartial and declare only ballots cast, Olagunju stated that the success of the election was also dependent on residents coming out enmasse on election day. The event also saw the OYSIEC boss listing four other documents aside from Permanent Voter Card (PVC) that will be tenable by voters to cast their ballot. He listed the other acceptable items to vote as Temporary Voters Slip, Drivers Licence, National Identity Card and International Passport. Speaking further, Olagunju said what was imperative was for a person’s name on any of the identification documents to match the name on the Voters Register, which he said will he displayed across the 33 local government election areas from next week. Olagunju added that he had instructed security agencies whose names are not on the voters register and present at the polling centres to be arrested. In his remarks, Director, NOA, Oyo State, Moshood Olaleye, urged residents of the state to elect those that are truthful, credible and those that have proven themselves to be close to the grassroots.
