Forex trading is legal in Canada, and quite popular too. With the increasing interest in the world of online trading, Forex has also experienced a rather strong increase in the number of traders making deals in the currency exchange market. The first step anyone hoping to be called a Forex trader has to take is to choose a broker that matches their trading style and level of expertise. Choosing among the best Canadian Forex brokers is easy. To make sure the broker you are choosing is legit, make sure they are registered with the appropriate regulatory bodies. In Canada, the main regulatory body, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), but also the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) are in charge of assuring the transparency of the brokers’ operations in the market, as well as protect the traders’ information and their money. However, in Canada, there are a few more entities in charge of overseeing the Forex market, depending on the region. In Toronto, we can find the Ontario Securities Commission, while for the region of British Columbia the regulatory entity in charge is the British Columbia Securities Commission. Lastly, in the Montreal and Quebec area, there is the Autorité des Marchés Financiers. Forex trading, also normally called FX, is the exchange of one currency for another.
