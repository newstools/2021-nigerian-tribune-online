The leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has expressed shock over the sudden death of Yinka Odumakin, the spokesperson of Afenifere, an Apex Yoruba Cultural Organization. Yinka Odumakin, 54, an activist, at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTh), was said to have died out of coronavirus complications. Kanu, during a broadcast, described Odumakin as a selfless leader who he said stood for the poor. He regretted that his death was shocking and “it was untrue that he died of COVID-19.” Kanu, who said that “Odumakin was a respected fine gentleman who stood for truth,” added that “he will not be forgotten by IPOB. Biafra will be restored. And he will always be respected.” Meanwhile, the IPOB leader, had stated that IPOB is a peaceful movement that uses a peaceful approach to agitate for the restoration of Biafra to independence and legitimacy, warning those who give IPOB/ESN bad name to discredit it before the international community, to stop or face the wrath of God. Kanu, while praying to God to help the people of Biafra to regain freedom, noted that IPOB/ESN is being funded by Biafrans across the world. “If we can sustain ESN without any external help, IPOB deserves our respect. Let God restore Biafra. For His people to be free from oppression and suffering,” Kanu prayed.
