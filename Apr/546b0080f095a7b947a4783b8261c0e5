Despite having a record-breaking return of 50 per cent at the close of trading in the year 2020, the Nigerian Stocks Exchange (NSE) has taken a steep walk towards the red line to record a 3.04 per cent dip by the end of the first quarter of 2021. The overall market performance indicator, All-Share Index (ASI), declined by 1,225.59 basis points or 3.04 per cent to close at 39,045.13 basis points on March 31, 2021, as against 40,270.72 basis points recorded on January 4, 2021. Consequently, the market capitalisation which represents the market value of all listed companies lost N628 billion to close the period under review at N20.429 trillion from N21.057 trillion at which it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021. At the end of the first month, the local bourse ended January with positive sentiments from the previous year, gaining 5.3 per cent. However, since January, the Nigerian equities went southward to lose 5.6 per cent in February and 1.9 per cent loss in March. Despite impressive results submitted to the NSE and robust dividend payments, especially following a financial year marred by the Covid-19 Pandemic, Nigerian stocks suffered major losses due to several factors some of which include rising yields in government securities, reallocation of portfolios by investors, profit-taking, and the deteriorating situation in the economy.
