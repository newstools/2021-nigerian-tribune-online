If we tell CCECC to get this place ready for commission in the next two weeks, this place will be ready,” he stated. Amaechi, however, charged the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and other Agencies at the port to ensure that the train is highly utilized in lifting cargo when the rail project is fully commissioned. He tasked the management of NPA to ensure that trucks are cleared at the port, adding that only registered trucks moving goods imported or to be exported be allowed into the ports.
