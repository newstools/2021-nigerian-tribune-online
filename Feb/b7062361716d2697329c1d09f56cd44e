If you do not have a lot of experience and knowledge of the stock market, the stock trading information available on the market section of newspapers or CNBC should be able to help you understand the basics. Terms and phrases like “intraday highs” and “earnings movers” are not very important to the average investors. Even if they’re in it for the long term, they still don’t have to worry about what these words mean, or about the flashes of green or red that you see on the bottom of your television screens. You should be able to enter the stock market as an investor without understanding the stock market much at all. However, on the other hand, if you are looking to trade stocks or want to learn how to trade stocks, you will need to understand many things about the stock market. It is important, before you enter the market as a stock trader, to learn more about stock trading for beginners. Stock market basics.  The exchanges, like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, are what makes the stock market. Stocks are listed on these exchanges, which brings together the sellers and the buyers. These exchange platforms will act as the market for the shares of the listed stocks. The exchange does the work of tracking the supply and demand and as well as the price of each stock. It is important to note that the stock market isn’t your typical market, and you can’t just show up and get your shares off a shelf the way most people buy products from the grocery store. These days, the traders are normally represented by online brokers in the stock market. You place your trades in the stock market through a broker, then your broker will deal with the exchange on your behalf. You might only be able to perform trades when the exchange is open and your broker is ready.  Understanding the stock market. When analysts or the stock market experts talk about the stock market being up or down, they’re normally referring to the major market indexes. A market index will track the performance of a group of stocks and they can either represent a specific sector of the market or the market, like retail companies or technology. You will hear a lot about the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite as they are often used as proxies for the overall performance of the stock market. Investors can use these indexes to set a standard for the performance of their own portfolios and, in other cases, to make better stock trading decisions. Investors may invest in an entire index as well through exchange traded funds (ETFs) or index funds, which track a specific index or a sector of the market. Stock trading information. A lot of investors will build a diversified portfolio of stocks or stock index funds and will want to hold on to it with the hope that it will grow as it goes through bad times and good times. However, investors who like a little more action will want to take part in stock trading instead of just buying stocks and waiting for their value to grow. Stock trading will involve buying and selling stocks much more frequently in order to make profits. It is important to note that the stock traders will try to take advantage of short term market events to sell their stocks and make profits, or buy new stocks at a lower price. Some of the stock traders will use the strategy known as day trading, which means that they will buy and sell stocks throughout the day. Others will simply be active traders, placing a good number of trades every month. Investors who are looking to trade stocks will be required to do a lot of research. They might have to devote a few hours of their day in order to keep up with the market. Traders will mostly rely on technical analysis, using tools to predict a stock’s movements and to look for trends and trading opportunities. Many online brokers will also offer information about trading stocks, including stock research, analyst reports and charting tools. Ojudu, Sunday Igboho and the Sangba allegory SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
