A drunken woman who smacked a German police officer from behind landed in a cell to sober up and is facing charges of sexual harassment authorities said on Tuesday. The 28-year-old woman spanked the officer at the main train station in Dortmund on Monday, according to a police statement. She allegedly approached the policeman from behind and hit him “abruptly on his buttocks,” it said. Because she was unable to show identification, she was taken to the nearby station, where the woman is said to have insulted the officers. Police said the entire incident was recorded on the officers’ body cameras.
