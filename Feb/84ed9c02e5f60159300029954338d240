The Comptroller also remarked that the Area Command, under his management, had commenced an operation, code-named ‘Operation Fish Out’ through the invocation of Sections 147 and 151 of the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) Cap C45 LFN 2004, which gives operatives power to search premises for goods not customed and to reward informants with genuine intelligence. He said: “We shall sharpen our intelligence and enforcement capabilities to fight smuggling, and enforce compliance with reference to extant laws guiding our procedures and rules of engagement. “We shall deploy all our strength and available logistics to ensure success in the battle against those who like to dare the capability of officers of the area command. Oyo and Osun States will be made unbearable for economic saboteurs.” Abdulkadir warned people perceived to be on the side of the smugglers by revealing Customs officers’ movement and action to them, saying that they would be tracked, apprehended and prosecuted in accordance with the law. Commending the area command operatives who, according to him, had been unrelenting and uncompromising in the face of challenges, the Comptroller also acknowledged the contributions of stakeholders, traditional and community leaders in providing enabling environment for officers to function properly.
