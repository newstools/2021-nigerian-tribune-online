To improve its customers’ experience and streamline their time at the airport, Air France has announced a pilot of the ICC AOKpass, supported by MedAire/International SOS. The ICC AOKpass is a mobile app, available on smartphones that allows passengers to carry a secure record of the results of their COVID-19 test carried out in a partner laboratory. AOK Pass is currently a partner of many laboratories around the world, including the Cerballiance and Biogroup groups in France. Once at the airport, passengers present the certificate on the app, instead of a paper test, the ICC AOKpass provides secure verification, in line with the regulations of the destination country, via a network secured by blockchain technology. According to Air France management “This four-week test period, organized with the support of Paris Aéroport, which will begin on March 11, 2021 on all Air France flights from Paris-CDG to Pointe-à-Pitre (Guadeloupe) and Fort-de-France (Martinique), will be carried out on a voluntary basis, in order to test the operation of the app in real conditions and to find out the opinions of test clients. “Air France will share this feedback with the other airlines in the Skyteam alliance, which are currently testing various solutions for digitising health documents.                   “In addition to testing the ICC AOKpass solution, Air France is doing everything it can to assist its customers and inform them in real time of developments in travel procedures. A dedicated website is available to them at airfrance.traveldoc.aero.” Since the start of the crisis, Air France said it has applied the strictest health measures and offers its customers total flexibility in their tickets, with the possibility of postponing or cancelling any trip planned before December 31, 2021, free of charge and without proof. These measures the airline said were grouped under the Air France Protect label and are reviewed regularly as the situation evolves. They recently earned Air France 4 stars in the Skytrax “COVID-19 Safety Rating.” Commenting on the development, Air France Senior Vice President, Customer Experience, Catherine Villar, declared “Improving and simplifying the customer experience is an ongoing priority for Air France. The testing of the AOKpass solution is fully in line with this framework and the approach initiated by the implementation of the Air France Protect label. “We are convinced that the changes we are all currently experiencing will change the way we travel in the long term and are committed to supporting all innovation projects that can help us meet these new challenges.” Air France places the health and safety of its customers and staff at the heart of its concerns. As part of its Air France Protect health and safety commitment, the company has introduced the strictest health and hygiene measures to ensure a safe trip.
