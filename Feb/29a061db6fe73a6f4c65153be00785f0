Though a truce is being sought between Bauchi state Governor, Sen Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir and his Benue State colleague, Samuel Ortom over the exchange of hot words, it has been suggested that politicians should watch their utterances in order not to overheat the polity. The suggestion was made by Bauchi State Commissioner of Environment and Housing, Muazu Hamisu Shira who described the tagging of his principal, Bala Mohammed as a ‘terrorist’ by the Benue state Governor, Samuel Ortom as ‘ungubernatorial’. The Commissioner who was reacting to the recent disagreement between the two Governors on the endemic farmers and herders clashes said that no matter what, it was ungentlemanly for the Benue state Governor to call his colleague a terrorist. According to him, such reckless remarks could trigger disaffection among the citizens of the two states thereby the need for leaders to watch what they say in public.

It will be recalled that that the Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri on Thursday appealed to the two Governors to sheath their swords and forgive each other for the best interest of the party.
