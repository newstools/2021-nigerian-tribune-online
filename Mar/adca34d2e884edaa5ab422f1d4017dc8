The Consumer Goods led the losers’ chart having recorded 6.3 per cent descent, followed by Insurance, Oil and Gas and Banking indices. Analysts however advised investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remained a significant headwind for corporate earnings. At Invest Advocate, analysts expect intermittent profit-taking to continue due to uncertainties about the direction of yields in the Fixed Income market.
