Kidnappers of a busload members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Region 30, Province 1, Kaduna State, have demanded N50 million for their release. This was made known to Tribune Online by a senior pastor of the church late Friday night He added that eight members were kidnapped from the church bus at about 6:00 p.m while on their way for a church assignment. “It’s true. It hapened around 6:00 p.m. They are asking for N50 million,” the RCCG cleric, who’s a Special Assistant to the General Overseer, disclosed. A church source in Kaduna had earlier told Tribune Online that the abducted persons were “adult missionaries, male and female, from Kaduna Province 1 going to Kafanchan for prayer work.” It will be recalled that an engineer, Mr Eje Kenny Faraday, who said he “narrowly escaped being a victim,” had broken the news on his Facebook wall with the photograph of the empty bus around 7.00 p.m. on Friday. “All passengers in the bus are just kidnapped along Kachia Road, Kilometre 63 from Kaduna,” he posted on his Facebook wall. The inscription on the side of the bus reads, ‘The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Region 30, Trinity Sanctuary, Kaduna.’ SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!! Abuja Man reveals (FREE) secret Fruits that
