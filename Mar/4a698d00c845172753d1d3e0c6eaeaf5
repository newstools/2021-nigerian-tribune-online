IN a bid to inculcate in every Nigerian the culture of good oral hygiene, toothpaste brand, Colgate,  in collaboration with the Nigerian Dental Students Association and the Nigerian Medical Students Association, reached out to 44 locations in rural communities across 31 states in Nigeria, as part of activities marking this year’s World Oral Health Day (WOHD). One of such visits was to  the Paiko community, in Gwagwalada area of Abuja, where the team engaged families, market women, children and conducted household calls to preach the message of adopting a good oral care habit in alignment with the 2021 theme “Be Proud of your Smile”. Speaking on the campaign, the Chief Executive Officer, Colgate Palmolive Tolaram, Mr. Girish Sharma, stated that he was particularly excited about the campaign since it had the potential of  transforming lives across the nation. He noted that the toothpaste brand’s  partnership with the Nigerian Dental Students Association and the Nigerian Medical Students Association made the impact even more far-reaching, as it enhanced the possibility of simultaneously combing through the nooks and crannies of over 44 communities across 31 states in a day. Sharma described the exercise as being in tune with the brand’s 2021 goal of touching more than 2million people through its Free Dental check up camps present in 9 states across Nigeria. The President, Nigerian Association of Dental Students, Michael Adejumo, stated that the decision of the association to partner with the brand was informed by the need to enhance publicity on good oral care habits across every state in Nigeria and around the world.
