The African Union (AU) has been asked to lend its voice to calls that seek to promote internal peace in Nigeria. The call is coming on the heels of the current state of security in the country. Mrs Morola Babalola made the call while giving her acceptance speech during the inauguration of herself and Mrs Olubukola Abitoye into the AU-ECOSOCC cluster committee, on Tuesday, in Abuja. She stressed that part of the objective of the union was to promote peace and security, hence the need for the African Union-Economic, Social and Cultural Council ( ECOSOCC) to champion such in the country. “What African Union stands for and why we are here in Nigeria is to promote the objectives of AU across all African states. Let us promote internal peace, AU stand for peace and security. “AU-ECOSOCC should lend its voice to calls promoting peace in Nigeria to say that the kidnappings, killings, banditry must stop,” she said. Earlier in his keynote address, Gbenga Adeleye, Head, AU ECOSOCC Nigeria Human Resources, Science and Technology (HRST) Cluster Committee said the council AU and Cluster committees were set up in each of the member states by the AU highest organ to work with governments and promote AU’s agenda. While expressing AU ECOSOCC Nigeria’s readiness to work and collaborate with the media, civil society organizations, and professionals including women, youths and persons with special abilities, he urged the new elected members of the AU ECOSOCC Nigeria Committee to bring their wealth of experience, professional skills and wisdom on board. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council ( ECOSOCC) is an advisory body of the African Union designed to give civil society organizations (CSOs) a voice within the AU institutions and decision-making processes.
