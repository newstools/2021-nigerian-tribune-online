Controversy over whether Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) or NIPOST has jurisdiction over the collection of stamp duties continued on Tuesday as FIRS once again said it will continue to be in charge. This is a counter to a recent media reports quoting Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Patami that President Muhammadu Buhari has ruled that NIPOST should take over the responsibility. In a statement, Director, Communications and Liaison, Abdullahi Ismaila Ahmad said Patami merely stated that NIPOST would henceforth produce the ADHESIVE STAMPS required by FIRS to denote Stamp Duties. “This position is in line with Section 2 of the Stamp Duties Act (as amended by Section 46 of the Finance Act 2020). “The FIRS, therefore, urges taxpayers, tax practitioners and the general public to ignore this unfortunate attempt to cause confusion by twisting the Minister’s speech. “The Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, is a patriot with an unarguable passion for the rule of law and stability of the country. “The FIRS remains the only federal agency permitted by law to collect Stamp Duties on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria. “Therefore, the FIRS urges all taxpayers to disregard the aforementioned fake news and continue to pay their Stamp Duties charges to the FIRS nationwide.”  Jobs!
