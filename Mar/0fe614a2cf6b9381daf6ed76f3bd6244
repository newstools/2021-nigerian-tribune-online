The Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, will on Tuesday present a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the establishment of the Federal University of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Abeokuta, before the Senate Committee on Health. Recall that the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, had during the commissioning of Telemedicine International Conference Hall and other projects at the Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta, informed the audience that the Senate Committee on Health would hold a public hearing on the Bill 2031 SB. 26 seeking the establishment of the university. The monarch who is a major proponent of the call for the establishment of the Medical University will lead other prominent Egba Chiefs and indigenes of repute before the committee. The MoU would no doubt be a further step to ensure the legal backing and successful take off of the tertiary health training varsity.  SHOCKING LIFE STORY!!!
