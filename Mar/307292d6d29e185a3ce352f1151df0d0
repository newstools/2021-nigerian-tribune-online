The Federal Government will deploy all necessary force to eliminate insurgents and bandits rather than negotiate with them, the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno, has declared. He said negotiating with the criminals would suggest weakness and incapacity on the part of government. The NSA spoke at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, during the weekly presidential ministerial briefing on Thursday. He said the government would not succumb to blackmail and the use of criminals by proxies to harass innocent citizens. He said: “While the government is not averse to talking, it must apply the necessary force because you can’t trust these people. “Government wants to use military assets to eliminate them but if along the line, they come out, good. It paints the picture of weakness, incapacity.” Jobs! Jobs!! Jobs!!!.
