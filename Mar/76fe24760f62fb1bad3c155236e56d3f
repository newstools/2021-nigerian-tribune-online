Kogi State governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello has charged contractors handling the construction of the Ganaja junction flyover to hasten pace by ensuring that the project is qualitatively completed even before the stipulated time of delivery. The Governor gave the charge during an unscheduled visit to the site on Saturday morning in Lokoja, the state capital. Bello described the road as the major link between North and East of Nigeria thus drawing heavy presence of vehicular movements causing traffic congestion that inconveniences road users and residents. To reduce the burden of hardship on road users, he called on the contractors to double efforts by deploying mechanisms that will accelerate work.
