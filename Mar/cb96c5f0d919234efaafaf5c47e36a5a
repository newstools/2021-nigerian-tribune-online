The Joint Organised Labour in Cross River State has issued a 24 hours ultimatum to the Cross River State government to secure the release of the state NLC chairman unharmed, otherwise, they will stage an industrial action and shut down government offices (MDAs) across the state. Recall that at his home, the state NLC chairman, Cross River State, Comrade Ben Ukpekpi, was kidnapped in Crospil Estate, Akapubuyo, a neighbourhood of metropolitan Calabar. Chairman Organized Labour, Cross River State on Tuesday morning on Hit 93.9 FM breakfast show said, “the decision to embark on strike after 24 hours, should the government fail to secure the release of the NLC chairman, unharmed,  was a decision of congress.” He added, “Government must wake up to its responsibilities. While we commend the effort of the governor in improving security in the metropolitan city, the Operation Akpakwu security outfit must be equipped to equally police the suburbs.” Until press time, efforts to reach the Police Public Relations Officer, Irene Ugbor and the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, proved abortive. Operation Akapkwu security outfit flagged one December 2020 by Governor Ayade of Cross River State. Hence, criminal elements have redeployed their operation base to suburban centres of the state.
