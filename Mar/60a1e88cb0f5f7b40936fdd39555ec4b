Our correspondent gathered that there had been noticeable improvement in traffic sitution following the take-off of the electronic call up system by the NPA. In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary of the Lagos State Government, Gboyega Akosile, the state government said residents had expressed happiness over the call up system introduced by the NPA. The NPA last week said that as part of the flag-off for the call up system, it had licensed eight truck parks. Speaking to maritime journalists in a virtual meeting, Hadiza Bala Usman, NPA MD, disclosed that the authority had advertised for 13 truck parks, but said that only eight were qualified among those that applied. She expressed optimism that with the call-up system, the gridlock in Apapa caused by movement of illegal trucks would be a thing of the past. She warned that any truck that had not been called up, but was found on the road in Apapa would be impounded. She insisted that shipping companies must have their own holding bays for empty containers.
